Hi, thanks for the download.

This project was developed in my second year of master's to learn how a gameloop works. It has been done in french.  

To Run the program go into the Debug file and run TetrisSFML.exe. Only working on windows

- DeltaTime is implemented, but not use to move tetromino.

- Memory Allocator (stack allocator) implemented but not used, beacause don't need it.

- ClicManager implemented but not used. He had for goal to be used to make buttons in the main menu and pause menu. But not implemented.
